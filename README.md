Create an Express server that serves static files and create an API that responds to HTTP GET requests

In this exercise, you will create an express server that serves static files and responds to a get request with data.

## Part One: Create a static server

### Setup

1. Fork and clone this repo
2. touch app.js
3. npm init
4. npm i express -S
5. echo node_modules > .gitignore
6. git add .
7. git commit -m â€˜initial commit'
8. Git push origin master

### Create a server in app.js

* Require Express and initialize an app
* Use `express.static()` to mount the directory that will serve static files
* Create the directory that you're referencing above
* Create an html and a css page in your static directory - don't spend much time styling - do just enough to check that everything is connected
* Use `app.listen` to run your server on a port
* Check that this works by running `nodemon app.js in your directory
* Git add, commit, push


## Part Two: Define a GET route at '/someanimal'

* Use your notes and the Express docs to create a route that returns some kind of data when a user sends a GET request to '/someanimal' 

## Part Three: 

* In a seperate git repo create a client project that has a simple html page and sends an ajax call to the API you created in step 2. Run your client on http-server. These do not have to be deployed. You can send a request from one port to another.  Just run the servers in different terminal windows.

## Paste a link to your client side repo here: 

* Make sure you add, commit and push all your changes on the server repo to your clone (this repo) and submit the assignment by pasting a link to your fork in [Workbook](https://workbook.galvanize.com/cohorts/66/articles/2945)
